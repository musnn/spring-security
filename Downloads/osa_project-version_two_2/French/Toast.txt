French Toast 

Ingredients
2 large eggs
80ml whole milk
40ml double cream
1 tsp vanilla extract
Â½ tsp cinnamon
4 thick slices brioche
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 tbsp butter
icing sugar and fresh berries, to serve (optional)

Instructions
1.Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Lay the brioche slices in a single layer in a shallow dish and pour the egg mixture over them. Allow to soak for 2-3 mins, then carefully turn over and soak for 2 mins more.
2.Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until foaming. Carefully lift 2 slices of the soaked brioche out of the dish and add to the frying pan. Fry for 3 mins on each side, until golden and crisp, then place on a wire rack over a baking tray in a warm oven while you repeat with the remaining slices.
3.Serve dusted in icing sugar and scattered with fresh berries, if you like.
